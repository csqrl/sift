# Changelog

## [0.0.2]

### Changed

- Fixed a bug where `Array.concat(Deep)`, `Dictionary.merge(Deep)` and `Set.merge` would not accept holes (`nil` values) in their arguments. This would cause the function to stop processing further arguments once it found a `nil` value.
- Fixed a bug where `Array.insert` would not insert the element at the correct index. An index of `0` will now insert the element at the end of the array. `length+1` will also insert the element at the end of the array. `length+2` (or greater) will be ignored, and the original array will be returned.
- Bumped tooling versions:
  - rojo to v7.1.1
  - stylua to v0.13.1
  - selene to v0.17.0
